TopAlbums

iOS application
Swift 5.0 and XCode 11.3

Project: This iOS application fetches the top 100 albums from the Apple RSS Feed API.

Used MVVM Architecture. This design helps in keeping the view controller light.

Features:
*On launching the app, a list of the top 100 albums schools are fetched & Rendered.
*TableView prefetching delegates used to prefetch the image data & cancel the prefetch request.
*Selecting an album, would navigate the user to the album details view.
*No Storyboard/ XIB used.
*Safe Area Insets
*Portrait & Landscape supported.

Additions:
Accessibility-Voice Over for the albums list as well as the details screen.

Assumptions / Constraints:
-Even though NSURLSession is used to fetch the data, due to the time constraint, networking layer wasn't completely added. Have hardcoded the URL's & related methods. Same w.r.t the Error Handling.

Scope for improvement:
-Implement proper network layer & error Handling
-Implement URL caching, so that the same API wouldn't be refetched multiple times & image caching.
-Add RefreshControl for TableView to refetch new data.
-Search Functionality
-Activity indicator for each image while loading/ default image
-Unit Test Cases.

Known Issues:
AutoLayoutConstraint warning related to the 'Navigate to Music' button. Due to time constraint wasn't able to debug & fix it.
